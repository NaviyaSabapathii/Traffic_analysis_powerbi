ROAD ACCIDENT DATA ANALYSIS (2017-2021) POWERBI DASHBOARD
OVERVIEW:
--This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road accident data in Australia from 2017 to 2021. The Power BI dashboard is designed to uncover patterns, trends, and key metrics that can support decision-making in traffic safety and policy planning.

KEY FEATURES:
1. Crash Distribution by Region
--Crash counts grouped by state, age group, and remoteness area
--Comparative analysis based on high-speed zones and speed limits
--Breakdown of crash occurrences across regions such as Major Cities, Inner and Outer Regional Australia

2. Crash Pattern Analysis
--Crash trends based on season, time of day, and gender
--Crash severity breakdown (low vs high severity)
--Year-wise distribution of total crashes from 2017 to 2021

3. Road Accident Summary

--Total number of crashes and average driver age
--Number of crashes in high-speed zones and on weekends
--Road user involvement including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists

KEY INSIGHTS:
--A majority of crashes occurred in major cities and high-speed zones.
--Winter and summer seasons recorded higher crash frequencies.
--Male drivers were involved in more crashes across all time slots compared to females.
--Drivers were the most common road users involved in accidents, followed by passengers and pedestrians.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES:
--Power BI Desktop
--Data modeling and transformation using Power BI
--Visual storytelling through interactive dashboards and custom filters
